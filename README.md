# Assignment 1

**Contribution:**

I worked in a group with Nonie Mathur & Santiago Carillo. We worked both alone and together through the lab, and Nonie and I forked each 
other's repositories. 

**Process Summary:**

I set up a repository on compute and on github and created my first file. I then edited the text file in both locations to create a merge
conflict, which I then resolved by pulling from github and editing in compute before trying the push again. I then forked Nonie's repository (gittest_nm2565), cloned it on compute, and make changes to her file before pushing back to my fork of it on github. I then requested a merge and also accepted her merge request.
